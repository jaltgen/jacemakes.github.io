# High-Availability Secure Networking for Media Companies

## The Need for Speed (and Security)

The revolution is over. Digital acquisition and production of media is here. [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) has held true for the past 45+ years. A radical explosion in the speed of electronic information processing has set in motion the most fundamental shifts in the way we process information since the introduction of mechanical movable type printing to western culture by Johannes Gutenberg in ca. 1450. In the field of media production, this digital revolution has brought digital film cameras and audio recording devices that can match almost all analog recording formats in terms of quality, and certainly in the availability of storage quantity. With the digital acquisition of video and audio sources comes the digital distribution of source, intermediate and master material via computer networks. 

This reality forces production and postproduction providers to invest in high-performance network infrastructure in their [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network): 10Gbps or even 40Gbps Ethernet over dedicated fibre-optical connections to high-capacity storage solutions are becoming necessary with the increase of both spatial- as well as color-resolution beyond FullHD and 8bit. 4K and larger sources in 10bit, 12bit and beyond are necessary to deliver the quality necessary for high-grade finishing. Such systems generally called "Storage Area Networks" - SANs in short - rely on managed networks provided by business-grade hardware. Consumer routers as provided by Internet Service Providers or switches bought cheap at your local electronics retailer have no place in these networks. Neither do Cat. 5 cables suffice to deliver the throughput you need to keep the work going in your suites.

A crucial requirement that mustn't be overlooked is that of security. With the advantages of server-based post workflows comes the risk of a breach of network security. With all of your production's expensive assets on a series of networked servers, these assets could potentially become accessible from without your LAN. If an intruder gains access to your network through the internet, they may steal, leak or delete your assets, potentially causing significant damage to your business. You may have to restore data from a backup - if there is one, may be liable to pay damages and loose current or future work. It is therefore imperative to plan for adequate network security, even in small post houses or one-man shows when NAS / SAN technology is used.

One aspect so far overlooked is your connection to wide-area networks. While local high-speed connectivity is one pillar of a functioning postproduction, the speed with which you can access wide-area networks (WAN) - e.g. the internet - can severely limit your ability to download assets, upload deliverables to your clients or run backups or archive requests to a cloud. This can foreseeably even be the determining factor in how you must time and offer services, if they require large up- or downloads. Also, in the world of IP based live video production, adequate bandwidth is quintessential to deliver your product.

In this whitepaper I will outline requirements and solutions for these three aspects: 
1) high-speed local connectivity for 4K and above content
2) maintaining accessability and ease of use while ensuring security of assets
3) options to maximize internet bandwidth

## Maximizing Local Bandwidth

The first thing you should do when thinking about upgrading your network is this: throw out your cheap consumer router that the internet provider gave (or sold or rented) you with your contract. Almost everything about it is bad. The wifi antennas are most likely small, the routing options are limited, firewall options are ridiculous, the internal switching bandwith is small. It might even be throtteling certain ports, for example when you use Voice-Over-IP. It is a dangerous, slow piece of junk that has no place in a high-performance, secure network. This applies to ordinary DSL-type internet connections. When you are connected via fibre-optics or TV cable connection (usually identified by a coax cable), this might be a little more complicated.
