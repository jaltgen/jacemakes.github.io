# High-Availability Secure Networking for Media Companies

## The Need for Speed (and Security)

The revolution is over. Digital acquisition and production of media is here. (Moore's law)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law] has held true for the past 45+ years. A radical explosion in the speed of electronic information processing has set in motion the most fundamental shifts in the way we process information since the introduction of mechanical movable type printing to western culture by Johannes Gutenberg in ca. 1450. In the field of media production, this digital revolution has brought digital film cameras and audio recording devices that can match almost all analog recording formats in terms of quality, and certainly in the availability of storage quantity. With the digital acquisition of video and audio sources comes the digital distribution of source, intermediate and master material via computer networks. 

This reality forces production and postproduction providers to invest in high-performance network infrastructure in their (LAN)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network]: 10Gbps or even 40Gbps Ethernet over dedicated fibre-optical connections to high-capacity storage solutions are becoming necessary with the increase of both spatial- as well as color-resolution beyond FullHD and 8bit. 4K and larger sources in 10bit, 12bit and beyond are necessary to deliver the quality necessary for high-grade finishing. Such systems generally called "Storage Area Networks" - SANs in short - rely on managed networks provided by business-grade hardware. Consumer routers as provided by Internet Service Providers or switches bought cheap at your local electronics retailer have no place in these networks. Neither do Cat. 5 cables suffice to deliver the throughput you need to keep the work going in your suites.

A crucial requirement that mustn't be overlooked is that of security. With the advantages of server-based post workflows comes the risk of a breach of network security. With all of your production's expensive assets on a series of networked servers, these assets could potentially become accessible from without your LAN. If an intruder gains access to your network through the internet, they may steal, leak or delete your assets, potentially causing significant damage to your business. You may loose a contract, have to pay fines and might be forced to run expensive restores from your backups - if there are any.
