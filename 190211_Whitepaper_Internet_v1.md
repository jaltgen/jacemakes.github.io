# High-Availability Secure Networking for Media Companies

The revolution is over. Digital acquisition and production of media is here. (Moore's law)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law] has held true for the past 45+ years, meaning a radical explosion in the speed of electronic information processing has set in motion the most fundamental shifts in the way we process information since the introduction of mechanical movable type printing to western culture by Johannes Gutenberg in ca. 1450. In the field of media production, this digital revolution has brought digital film cameras and audio recording devices that can match almost all analog recording formats in terms of quality, but certainly in the availability of storage quantity. With the digital acquisition of video and audio sources comes the digital distribution of source, intermediate and master material via computer networks.
