# Frequently Asked Questions

## What project details do you need to grade the project?

Some basic details have to be clear before beginning the color grading process. Because it informs many other decisions, the delivery format needs to be clear. Is it a TV program needing to conform to broadcast-safe standards? If so, what are the specific station requirements? A project going for digital delivery, be it social media or digital-out-of-home advertising, might have other requirements. When distribution is unclear, maybe grading in DCI-P3 color space might be advisable to facilitate creation of cinema and Rec.709 masters later. When the output format is fixed, the gamma and gammut (color space) of the material provided for grading must be defined. It could be ARRI Log C, Sony sLog.3, Rec.709 off a consumer camera - either way, knowing this will speed up a fully color-managed grading workflow.

## Do you need a picture-locked edit to begin grading?

No. In fact, I like to join projects as early as possible. This way, all involved can begin crafting the desired look from pre-production through the actual color grade. If I join at a later date, I can create a look based on selected takes or a rough-cut. It is also possible to color-grade a selection of clips which can then be taken into an online-edit - this is comes with a few disadvantages, though. Ideally, we can watch the final edit with the grade applied in DaVinci prior to delivery.
